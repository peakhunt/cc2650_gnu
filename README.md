# cc2650_gnu

The goal of this project is to waste my time seting up a complete GNU based development environment for TI's CC2650 BLE chip.

Getting more and more disappointed by TI these days. Always have to waste a lot of time in setting up environments and bringing things up when working with TI chips. STM32/nRF chips are much more better!
